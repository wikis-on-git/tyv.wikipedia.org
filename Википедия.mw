my note 

My dad said'oh' When he realised what Kenny was holding.
No- actually he didn't say ' ho ' It was just that his mouth made the shape it would
have made if he had said ' oh' but nothing came out.The first words he actually said were `Bloody hell!.
Kenny stared at my dad ' then at the badger " then at me.Then he thrust the badger behind his back.
„ I haven't got anything '" he said." Have I ' samit?"
Samit looked around in confusion.My dad helped him out.„Go home' samit lad'" he said.He didn't say it unkindly.
Now all the other kids had melted away and it was just me and Dad and Kenny and the badger. Tina was still looking over the rim of her box.
„Where's this from?" My dad asked. " I don't know," said Kenny. He'd stopped trying to hide the badger and was holding it in front of him again.It didn't seem to mind. I thought I'd be best off with the truth.So I told Dad about Jezbo's and Rich and Rop' and the death of the old badger. 
When I said Jezbo's name my dad stiffened, like someone had yanked the hairs at the back of his neck.But he didn't say anything until I'd finished the story.About half way through Kenny got bored with holding the badger and put it back in the box with the dog.
At the end my dad said," you can't keep it, son.There's laws about this.If the police find out I've got a wild animal,I'll be in breach of my bail.you know What that means."
