 '''The Complete Lyrics'''
 
 sometimes you can fix something by just being a prick
 winning by intimidation
 
 sometimes you can fix something by just lifting your skirt
 it's the ultimate distraction
 
 i poke button
 i want action
 let's hear some gears and see some smoke
 
 no dilly-dally
 move your heiny
 this is the age of "go for broke"
 
 sometimes you can fix something by just kissing some ass
 if you don't mind humiliation
 
 sometimes you can fix something by just smoking a pipe
 academic contemplation
 
 so pathetic  no mechanic
 no steady eye, no magic touch
 
 no screw driver
 ball peen hammer
 and mr. fix-it's gone to lunch
 
 not personal?
 yeah it's personal...
 what did i ever do to you?
 
 no crap from
 contraptions
 just do what i tell you to do
 
 sometimes you can fix something by just blaming your mom
 everybody loves a victim
 
 sometimes you can fix something by just cracking a joke
 humor is greasy lubrication
 
 sometimes you can fix something by just cooking the books
 wealth is all about perception
 
 sometimes you can fix something by just smoking a joint
 stoner free association
 
 broke down, lifeless
 junkyard worthless
 no tweezer jesus in the house  
 
 so desperate 
 so dependent
 pay any price to dope it out 
 
 i want genius
 i wanna suss
 the perfect kluge, the devil glitch
 
 oh, hosanna
 socket messiah
 the only jesus worth a shit
 
 JAM
